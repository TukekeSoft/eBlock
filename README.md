# eBlock
eBlock is the enhanced versión of great Scratch version [mBlock 3.4.5](https://github.com/Makeblock-official/mBlock), is opensource and non commercial.  

# Why eBlock
There a lot of people that preffers to code in c/c++ and not in Python so we'll keep supporting this versión to be able to code every kind of boards, not only Arduino ones.
