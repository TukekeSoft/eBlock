## Why eBlock

eBlock is based on the popular open source application [mBlock 3.4.5](https://github.com/Makeblock-official/mBlock) (a formidable work from Makeblock .Co, Ltd. company), many users still feel comfortable using that version of scratch due to simplicity.

And for those of us who prefer to continue programming in **c/c ++** instead of Python

Makeblock is no longer maintaining that version of mBlock and recent versions of mBlock are no longer opensource so we decided to create a fork of mBlock 3.4.5 to continue supporting and adding many interesting features.
